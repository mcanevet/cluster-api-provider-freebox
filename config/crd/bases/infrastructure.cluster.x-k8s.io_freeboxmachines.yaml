                  conditions represent the current state of the FreeboxMachine resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Ready": the resource is fully functional and VM is running
                  - "VMCreated": the VM has been created on the Freebox
                  - "VMStarted": the VM has been started
                  - "InfrastructureReady": the infrastructure is ready for use

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
