## Code Generation Guidelines
- Always generate the minimum amount of code necessary for each change
- Make small, reviewable changes that can be easily understood
- Avoid large code blocks or comprehensive configurations in single edits
- Always verify latest version of tools before adding to mise.toml
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) - write tests first, then implement functionality
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages
